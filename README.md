# Clean Branches
## Description
Github CLI extension

Safely delete local branches that have no remotes and no hanging changes.

The extension uses `git branch -d` to delete the local branches, hence it will not delete branches with un-pushed changes.

What is does?
- Fetch the repo.
- Checkout the default branch (whatever that is) and pull changes (needed if we want to delete the current branch)
- Lists all local branches
- Lists all remote branches
- Lists branches with missing upstream to be deleted
- Deletes branches with no upstream and no un-pushed changes.

When the extension completes, it stays on `main` branch of the repo.

When using the `--dry-run` flag, the last delete branches command is skipped. All the rest is always performed.
## Usage
Execute it inside a git repo folder:
```bash
gh clean-branches [--dry-run]
```
Use the `--dry-run` flag to see the list of branches to be deleted before actually deleting them.

## Dependencies
The extension relays on:
- gh CLI 2.0
- zsh
- node.js

I may remove the last two dependencies, they are not really needed (pull requests are welcomed!). It helped me for fast developing it.

## Installation
```bash
gh extension install cottand/gh-clean-branches
```
